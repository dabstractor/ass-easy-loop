## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Foundation Safety Testing (Day 1-2)

**CRITICAL: No hardware implementation until these tests pass**

```bash
# Run foundation safety tests
cargo test battery_safety_tests --features testing

# Validate all safety boundaries
cargo test test_voltage_threshold_boundaries
cargo test test_over_voltage_protection  
cargo test test_unsafe_state_transitions
```

**Success Criteria:**
- All voltage thresholds correctly implemented
- Over-voltage protection triggers at >4.2V (ADC > 1800)
- State transitions follow safety rules
- No unsafe transitions allowed

### Phase 2: Core Logic Implementation (Day 3-5)

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Enhance `src/types/battery.rs` with Full and Fault states
2. Update `src/drivers/adc_battery.rs` with voltage conversion
3. Implement state detection logic from PRD specifications
4. Add battery logging features

**Validation Commands:**
```bash
# Build with battery features
cargo build --target thumbv6m-none-eabi --features battery-logs

# Test battery logic integration  
cargo test battery_hardware_validation --features testing

# Validate build size and memory usage
cargo test test_automated_build_size_validation
```

### Phase 3: Hardware Integration (Day 6-8)

**Hardware Setup Requirements:**
- TP4056 charging circuit on breadboard
- 10kΩ:5.1kΩ voltage divider to GPIO 26
- Variable power supply for testing (3.0V-4.5V range)
- Current measurement capability
- **DO NOT CONNECT ACTUAL BATTERY YET**

**Hardware Validation Sequence:**
```bash
# Flash firmware with hardware testing enabled
cargo run --features hardware-testing,battery-logs

# Start continuous monitoring
python3 host_tools/battery_monitor.py --duration 30 --log battery_test.csv

# Run hardware validation tests
cargo test --features hardware-testing test_adc_accuracy_with_reference
cargo test --features hardware-testing test_voltage_divider_stability
```

**Critical Hardware Tests:**
1. **ADC Accuracy**: Apply known voltages (3.0V, 3.3V, 3.6V, 4.2V)
   - Verify ADC readings within ±50mV tolerance
2. **Voltage Divider**: Confirm 10kΩ:5.1kΩ ratio accuracy
3. **State Detection**: Verify state transitions at correct voltages
4. **Over-voltage Protection**: CRITICAL - Test with 4.3V+ input

### Phase 4: Charging Circuit Integration (Day 9-11)

**SAFETY PROTOCOL - MANDATORY:**
- Use current-limited power supply (max 1.2A)
- Monitor temperature continuously  
- Have emergency disconnect ready
- Start with fully discharged LiPo (3.0V)
- **Never exceed 4.25V on battery terminals**

**TP4056 Integration Tests:**
```bash
# Monitor complete charge cycle
python3 host_tools/battery_monitor.py --duration 120 --log charge_cycle.csv

# Validate charge phases
cargo test test_complete_charge_cycle_timing --features hardware-testing

# Performance validation during charging  
cargo test test_pemf_timing_constant_current_phase --features hardware-testing
```

### Phase 5: Performance and Timing Validation (Day 12-14)

**Critical Requirement**: pEMF timing must remain within ±1% throughout charging

**Performance Test Protocol:**
```bash
# Generate pEMF signal at known frequency
# Start charging cycle
# Monitor timing accuracy via:
python3 host_tools/battery_monitor.py --config timing_validation.json

# Run comprehensive timing tests
cargo test performance_validation --features hardware-testing
cargo test test_task_priority_interference --features hardware-testing
```

**Performance Success Criteria:**
- pEMF frequency deviation < ±1% during all charge phases
- No timing degradation during ADC sampling rate changes
- Task priority system maintains real-time performance
- Long-term stability over 60+ minute charge cycles

## Test Execution Commands

### Daily Development Workflow

```bash
# Morning validation routine (2 minutes)
cargo check --target thumbv6m-none-eabi --features testing

```

## Monitoring and Logging Strategy

### Real-Time Safety Monitoring

The system provides multiple monitoring layers:

1. **Firmware Logging** (via USB HID):
   - Battery state transitions
   - Voltage readings with timestamps
   - Charge phase progression
   - Safety violations

2. **Host-Side Validation** (battery_monitor.py):
   - Real-time safety limit checking
   - State transition validation
   - Charge progression analysis
   - Statistical reporting

3. **Test Result Logging**:
   - CSV output for analysis
   - JSON configuration for limits
   - Automated report generation

### Sample Monitoring Session

```bash
# Start device monitoring
python3 host_tools/battery_monitor.py \
    --duration 60 \
    --log battery_validation.csv \
    --config safety_limits.json

# Monitor system logs simultaneously  
python3 host_tools/log_monitor.py --file system_logs.txt

# Generate validation config
python3 host_tools/battery_monitor.py --generate-config battery_config.json
```

## Safety Validation Requirements

### Critical Safety Tests (MUST PASS)

1. **Over-Voltage Protection**: System must detect >4.2V and enter fault state
2. **Under-Voltage Protection**: System must detect <3.0V and enter low state  
3. **State Transition Safety**: Invalid transitions must be blocked
4. **Thermal Protection**: System must respond to over-temperature
5. **Current Limiting**: Charge current must not exceed 1A

### Safety Test Execution

```bash
# Critical safety validation
cargo test test_over_voltage_protection
cargo test test_under_voltage_protection
cargo test test_unsafe_state_transitions
cargo test test_thermal_protection

# Hardware safety tests (use with extreme caution)
cargo test --features hardware-testing test_over_voltage_protection
# ^ Uses current-limited supply to test 4.3V+ input
```

## Performance Requirements

### Timing Accuracy Requirements

- **Primary Requirement**: pEMF timing accuracy ±1% during all charging phases
- **ADC Impact**: Increased sampling rate must not degrade timing
- **Task Priority**: Battery monitoring must not interfere with pEMF generation
- **Long-term Stability**: Performance maintained over complete charge cycle

### Performance Validation

```bash
# Timing accuracy validation
cargo test test_pemf_timing_constant_current_phase
cargo test test_pemf_timing_constant_voltage_phase
cargo test test_adc_sampling_timing_impact
cargo test test_long_term_timing_stability

# Performance monitoring
python3 host_tools/battery_monitor.py --config timing_validation.json
```

## Integration with Existing System

### Cargo Feature Integration

The validation strategy integrates with existing feature flags:

```toml
# Cargo.toml features for testing
[features]
default = []
usb-logs = []
battery-logs = []          # Battery-specific logging  
system-logs = []
development = ["usb-logs", "battery-logs", "system-logs"] 
testing = ["development"]   # All logging for testing
hardware-testing = ["testing"] # Hardware-in-the-loop tests
production = []            # Minimal features for production
```

### Build Commands by Phase

```bash
# Development phase
cargo run --features development

# Testing phase  
cargo test --features testing
cargo run --features hardware-testing

# Production build
cargo build --target thumbv6m-none-eabi --features production --release
```

3. **Production Testing**: Extended testing with multiple charge cycles
4. **Certification Prep**: Prepare for any required safety certifications
5. **User Interface**: Implement user-facing battery status indicators

## Emergency Procedures

### Safety Emergency Stop
```bash
# If any safety violation detected:
1. Immediately disconnect USB power
2. Remove battery connections  
3. Review logs: python3 host_tools/log_monitor.py --file emergency.log
4. Analyze failure: cargo test battery_safety_tests --features testing
5. Do not reconnect until root cause identified
```

### System Recovery
```bash
# After safety incident:
1. Run full safety validation: cargo test battery_safety_validation
2. Hardware inspection and testing
3. Graduated re-testing starting from Level 1
4. Document incident and preventive measures
```

This validation strategy ensures safe, reliable implementation of battery charging while maintaining the critical ±1% pEMF timing requirement throughout the development process.
