## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Real-time Progress Tracking (Requirement 11.1)

**Enhanced ProgressStatus Data Structure:**
- Added detailed progress metrics including current test progress percentage
- Implemented health status monitoring (healthy/warning/error)
- Added performance metrics tracking (tests per second, success rate, completion percentage)
- Enhanced activity tracking with last activity timestamps

**Real-time Status Updates:**
- Periodic status reports every 10 seconds (configurable)
- Progress estimation with completion time calculations
- Current test progress tracking with sub-test granularity
- Multi-device progress aggregation and reporting

### 2. Enhanced Device Communication Logging (Requirement 11.2)

**Protocol Debugging Features:**
- Detailed USB HID message logging with timestamps

- Log level detection from message content

**Communication Correlation:**
- Command-response correlation with unique correlation IDs
- Latency measurement between command sent and response received
- Sequence number tracking for message ordering
- Protocol details capture (checksums, payload sizes, command types)

**Enhanced CommunicationLog Structure:**
```python
@dataclass
class CommunicationLog:
    timestamp: float
    device_serial: str
    direction: str  # 'sent' or 'received'
    message_type: str
    data: Any
    correlation_id: Optional[str] = None
    raw_bytes: Optional[bytes] = None
    latency_ms: Optional[float] = None  # For request-response pairs
    sequence_number: Optional[int] = None
    protocol_details: Dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)
```

### 3. Enhanced Failure Capture and System State Snapshots (Requirement 11.3)

**Comprehensive System State Snapshots:**
- Automatic snapshot capture on test failures
- Device logs collection (last 50 entries)
- Communication history capture (last 20 entries)
- Performance metrics at failure point
- System state including active tests and progress
- Error context preservation

**Enhanced Failure Analysis:**
- Failure timeline tracking with timestamps
- Failure pattern analysis by test name and error type
- Error categorization (timeout, communication, hardware, memory, validation)
- Device-specific failure tracking
- Recovery suggestions based on failure patterns

**SystemStateSnapshot Structure:**
```python
@dataclass
class SystemStateSnapshot:
    timestamp: float
    device_serial: str
    test_name: str
    system_state: Dict[str, Any]
    device_logs: List[str]
    communication_history: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    performance_metrics: Dict[str, float]
    error_context: Optional[str] = None
```

### 4. Verbose Logging Modes with Protocol Information (Requirement 11.4)

**Multi-level Logging System:**
- **MINIMAL**: Only critical events (failures, major progress updates)
- **NORMAL**: Test lifecycle events and basic progress
- **VERBOSE**: All events with data summaries and periodic status reports
- **DEBUG**: Full protocol debugging with raw data, checksums, and detailed analysis

**Protocol Debugging Features:**
- Command checksum calculation and validation
- Payload JSON serialization tracking
- Raw bytes capture and hexadecimal representation
- Message parsing and content analysis
- Communication timing and latency analysis

### 5. Periodic Health Checks and Status Reports (Requirement 11.5)

**Automated Health Monitoring:**
- Periodic health checks every 30 seconds (configurable)
- Stalled test detection (no activity for >60 seconds)
- High failure rate detection (>20% warning, >50% error)
- Communication imbalance detection (too many pending commands)
- Device responsiveness monitoring

**Periodic Status Reporting:**
- Automatic status reports every 10 seconds during verbose/debug logging
- Progress summaries with completion percentages
- Health status updates for all devices
- Performance metrics reporting
- Estimated completion time updates
