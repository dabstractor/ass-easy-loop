name: "Comprehensive Unit Testing for ass-easy-loop Embedded System"
description: |
  Implementation of comprehensive unit testing framework for the ass-easy-loop embedded Rust project with focus on RTIC tasks, hardware abstractions, and safety-critical systems.

---

## Goal

**Feature Goal**: Implement a comprehensive unit testing framework that validates all core functionality of the ass-easy-loop embedded system including waveform generation, battery monitoring, USB communication, and safety systems.

**Deliverable**: Complete unit test suite with >80% code coverage, integrated into the existing Cargo testing workflow, with mock implementations for hardware dependencies and validation of all safety-critical functions.

**Success Definition**: All unit tests pass consistently, safety-critical functions have 100% coverage, and the testing framework enables rapid validation of code changes without requiring hardware access.

## User Persona (if applicable)

**Target User**: Firmware developers working on the ass-easy-loop project who need to validate code changes and ensure system reliability.

**Use Case**: Developers implementing new features or fixing bugs need to validate their changes don't break existing functionality and meet safety requirements.

**User Journey**: 
1. Developer makes code changes
2. Developer runs `cargo test` to validate changes
3. Test results show pass/fail status with detailed error information
4. Developer addresses any failing tests
5. All tests pass, code is ready for integration

**Pain Points Addressed**: 
- Time-consuming manual hardware testing for every change
- Difficulty validating safety-critical code paths
- Lack of regression testing for complex waveform algorithms
- Inability to test error conditions without hardware faults

## Why

- **Business value and user impact**: Reliable firmware with fewer bugs, faster development cycles, and proven safety compliance
- **Integration with existing features**: Testing framework integrates with existing RTIC structure and Cargo build system
- **Problems this solves and for whom**: Enables developers to validate code changes quickly and confidently without hardware access, ensuring safety-critical systems work correctly

## What

Implementation of comprehensive unit tests for all modules in the ass-easy-loop project:
- Waveform generation algorithms with mathematical accuracy validation
- Battery monitoring state detection and safety limit checking

### Known Gotchas of our codebase & Library Quirks

```rust
// CRITICAL: RTIC tasks require special testing approaches due to real-time constraints
// Example: Use mock monotonic timers for timing-dependent tests

// CRITICAL: Atomic operations in SafetyFlags require careful testing for thread safety
// Example: Test race conditions with multiple threads accessing flags

// CRITICAL: Floating point comparisons need epsilon-based assertions
// Example: Use approx crate for waveform value comparisons
```

## Implementation Blueprint

### Data models and structure

Create the core test data models, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all system states and edge cases.

```rust
// Test data structures for battery monitoring
struct BatteryTestData {
    adc_value: u16,
    expected_state: BatteryState,
    expected_voltage_mv: u16,
}

// Test data structures for waveform generation
struct WaveformData {
    time_in_cycle: f32,
    waveform_factor: f32,
    duty_cycle: f32,
    expected_value: f32,
}

// Mock peripheral structures
struct MockAdc {
    readings: Vec<u16>,
    current_index: usize,
    error_injection: Option<BatteryError>,
}
```

### Implementation Patterns & Key Details

```rust
// Example: Waveform testing pattern with boundary value analysis
#[test]
fn test_sine_wave_boundary_values() {
    // Test exact boundary values
    assert_eq!(sine_wave(0.0), 0.5);  // Start of cycle
    assert_relative_eq!(sine_wave(0.25), 1.0, epsilon = 0.001);  // Peak
    assert_eq!(sine_wave(0.5), 0.5);  // Mid-cycle
    assert_relative_eq!(sine_wave(0.75), 0.0, epsilon = 0.001);  // Trough
    assert_eq!(sine_wave(1.0), 0.5);  // End of cycle
}

// Example: Battery state testing with threshold boundaries
#[test]
fn test_battery_state_thresholds() {
    // Test exact threshold values
    assert_eq!(BatteryState::from_adc_reading(1425), BatteryState::Low);
    assert_eq!(BatteryState::from_adc_reading(1426), BatteryState::Normal);
    assert_eq!(BatteryState::from_adc_reading(1674), BatteryState::Normal);
    assert_eq!(BatteryState::from_adc_reading(1675), BatteryState::Charging);
}

// Example: Mock ADC implementation pattern
impl MockAdc {
    fn new(readings: Vec<u16>) -> Self {
        Self {
            readings,
            current_index: 0,
            error_injection: None,
        }
    }
    
    fn inject_error(&mut self, error: BatteryError) {
        self.error_injection = Some(error);
    }
}
```
