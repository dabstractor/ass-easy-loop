PEMF Device Profiles Guide
Profile Differences

Inflammation: Uses the lowest frequencies to calm cytokine-driven inflammation.

Osteoarthritis / Joint Repair: Uses moderate frequencies to promote cartilage matrix production.

Bone Healing: Uses a similar moderate frequency range to osteoarthritis but with potentially shorter, more frequent sessions to drive osteogenic effects.

All profiles favor sharp-edged waveforms (sawtooth, triangular, square) over smooth sine waves to induce stronger biological effects.
