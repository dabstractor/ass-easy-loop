# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for adding automated testing and validation capabilities to the existing RP2040 pEMF/battery monitoring device. The system will provide a communication protocol that allows a host computer to remotely trigger the device to enter bootloader mode, enabling fully automated testing workflows including firmware flashing, validation, and continuous integration without manual intervention.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Bootloader Communication Protocol

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the device to respond to specific USB HID commands that trigger bootloader mode entry, so that I can automate firmware flashing and testing without physical access to the BOOTSEL button.

2. WHEN configuration query commands are received THEN the device SHALL return current timing parameters, thresholds, and operational settings
3. WHEN performance metrics are requested THEN the device SHALL return timing statistics, error counts, and resource usage data
4. WHEN diagnostic information is requested THEN the device SHALL return task execution times, memory usage, and system uptime
5. WHEN system health checks are requested THEN the device SHALL validate all subsystems and return pass/fail status for each

### Requirement 4: Host-Side Test Automation Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a Python-based test framework that can communicate with the device and orchestrate automated testing workflows, so that I can run comprehensive validation without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test framework starts THEN it SHALL automatically detect and connect to the test device via USB HID
2. WHEN running automated tests THEN the framework SHALL support test sequencing, result collection, and report generation
3. WHEN firmware flashing is required THEN the framework SHALL trigger bootloader mode, flash new firmware, and verify successful deployment
4. WHEN tests fail THEN the framework SHALL collect diagnostic logs and system state for debugging
5. WHEN test suites complete THEN the framework SHALL generate comprehensive reports with pass/fail status and performance metrics

### Requirement 5: Bootloader Mode Safety and Recovery

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the bootloader entry process to be safe and recoverable, so that devices don't become bricked during automated testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entering bootloader mode THEN the device SHALL ensure all critical data is saved and hardware is in a safe state
2. WHEN bootloader entry fails THEN the device SHALL remain in normal operation mode and log the failure reason
3. WHEN the device is stuck in bootloader mode THEN it SHALL automatically return to normal operation after a configurable timeout
4. WHEN bootloader commands are received during critical operations THEN they SHALL be queued and executed at the next safe opportunity
5. IF the bootloader entry process is interrupted THEN the device SHALL recover gracefully and continue normal operation

### Requirement 6: Test Command Security and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want bootloader and test commands to be authenticated and validated, so that only authorized testing tools can control the device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bootloader commands are received THEN they SHALL include a valid authentication token or signature
2. WHEN test commands are processed THEN they SHALL be validated for proper format and parameter ranges
3. WHEN unauthorized commands are received THEN they SHALL be rejected and logged as security events
4. WHEN command validation fails THEN the device SHALL return specific error codes indicating the validation failure type
5. WHEN security violations are detected THEN the device SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Requirement 7: Continuous Integration Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the automated testing framework to integrate with CI/CD pipelines, so that firmware validation can be part of the automated build and deployment process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CI/CD pipelines trigger tests THEN the framework SHALL support headless operation with exit codes indicating success/failure
2. WHEN running in CI environments THEN the framework SHALL support parallel testing with multiple devices
3. WHEN test results are generated THEN they SHALL be in standard formats (JUnit XML, JSON) for CI system integration
4. WHEN tests run in CI THEN the framework SHALL handle device discovery, setup, and cleanup automatically
5. WHEN CI tests fail THEN the framework SHALL provide detailed logs and artifacts for debugging

### Requirement 8: Performance Impact Minimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the automated testing capabilities to have minimal impact on normal device operation, so that production firmware behavior is not affected by test infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test commands are not active THEN the testing infrastructure SHALL consume minimal CPU and memory resources
2. WHEN normal operation is running THEN test command processing SHALL not affect pEMF pulse timing accuracy (Â±1% tolerance maintained)
3. WHEN bootloader commands are queued THEN they SHALL not interfere with battery monitoring or LED control tasks
4. WHEN the device is operating normally THEN test infrastructure SHALL be dormant and not generate unnecessary log messages
5. WHEN production builds are created THEN test command support SHALL be conditionally compiled based on build flags

### Requirement 9: Test Coverage and Validation Scenarios

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test scenarios that validate all device functionality, so that I can ensure firmware quality and catch regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running hardware validation tests THEN the framework SHALL test pEMF pulse generation timing, battery ADC readings, and LED control
