# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical need to comprehensively audit, validate, and fix all unit tests in the project. The entire project has been developed without running unit tests, resulting in a situation where none of the unit tests are currently passing. The primary issue is that the tests are written for `std` environment but the project targets `thumbv6m-none-eabi` (no_std). This spec will systematically review every test file, fix the no_std compatibility issues, validate test accuracy and completeness, and create an implementation plan to make all tests pass.

The project has extensive existing specs for automated testing bootloader, bootloader flashing validation, and project organization cleanup that provide context for the testing infrastructure and requirements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing unit tests to be thoroughly audited for no_std compatibility and accuracy, so that I can identify what needs to be fixed to work with the thumbv6m-none-eabi target.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test audit is performed THEN the system SHALL analyze every test file in the tests/ directory for no_std compatibility issues
2. WHEN each test file is analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify std library usage, missing no_std attributes, and incompatible test framework usage
3. WHEN test dependencies are reviewed THEN the system SHALL verify that all imports work in no_std environment and use appropriate alternatives
4. WHEN test assertions are examined THEN the system SHALL replace std-based assertions with no_std compatible alternatives
5. IF a test uses std-only features THEN the system SHALL document how to replace them with no_std equivalents or embedded-friendly alternatives

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand the specific no_std compatibility issues causing test failures, so that I can systematically fix them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are compiled THEN the system SHALL identify all "can't find crate for `std`" and "can't find crate for `test`" errors
2. WHEN compilation errors occur THEN the system SHALL identify missing `#![no_std]` attributes and incompatible std library usage
3. WHEN test framework issues are found THEN the system SHALL identify where `#[test]` attributes and test macros are not available
4. WHEN std library usage is detected THEN the system SHALL document which std features need no_std alternatives (Vec, HashMap, etc.)
5. IF tests use std-only testing features THEN the system SHALL identify how to replace them with embedded-compatible testing approaches

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive report of all no_std compatibility issues and required fixes, so that I can understand the scope of work needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audit is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a detailed report categorizing all no_std compatibility issues by test file
2. WHEN issues are categorized THEN the system SHALL group them by type (missing no_std attributes, std library usage, test framework issues, assertion problems)
3. WHEN priorities are assigned THEN the system SHALL rank fixes by complexity and impact on the existing automated testing infrastructure
4. WHEN dependencies are mapped THEN the system SHALL identify which tests depend on the existing test framework components and USB HID infrastructure
5. IF test infrastructure conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL document how to integrate no_std unit tests with the existing Python-based test framework

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all unit tests to compile and run successfully in the no_std environment, so that I can have confidence in the embedded test suite.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no_std fixes are applied THEN all unit tests SHALL compile successfully for the thumbv6m-none-eabi target
2. WHEN tests are executed THEN all unit tests SHALL pass their assertions using no_std compatible testing approaches
3. WHEN test coverage is measured THEN the system SHALL maintain existing coverage of the automated testing bootloader functionality
4. WHEN tests are run THEN each test SHALL work independently without requiring std library features
5. IF new test approaches are needed THEN they SHALL be compatible with the existing automated testing infrastructure and bootloader command system

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the no_std test suite to be maintainable and integrate with the existing testing infrastructure, so that future development can rely on comprehensive testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are refactored for no_std THEN they SHALL maintain compatibility with the existing automated testing bootloader system
2. WHEN test utilities are created THEN they SHALL be no_std compatible and reusable across multiple embedded test files
3. WHEN mocking is used THEN it SHALL work in no_std environment and accurately represent USB HID communication and bootloader behavior
4. WHEN tests are documented THEN they SHALL clearly explain how they integrate with the existing test framework and bootloader validation
5. IF embedded test performance impacts device operation THEN optimizations SHALL ensure tests don't interfere with pEMF timing requirements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless integration between the fixed no_std unit tests and the existing automated testing bootloader infrastructure, so that all testing approaches work together cohesively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no_std unit tests are fixed THEN they SHALL integrate with the existing Python test framework and bootloader flashing validation system
2. WHEN test results are collected THEN they SHALL be compatible with existing USB HID communication and test result reporting mechanisms
3. WHEN CI/CD integration is considered THEN unit tests SHALL work with the established automated testing bootloader and firmware flashing pipeline
4. WHEN test execution is automated THEN it SHALL work alongside existing bootloader entry commands and device validation scripts
5. IF conflicts exist between no_std unit tests and the automated testing infrastructure THEN they SHALL be resolved to maintain the unified testing strategy established in the existing specs
