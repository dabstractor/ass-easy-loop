# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Test basic firmware build using existing setup
  - Run `cargo build --release` in the current project
  - Fix any immediate compilation errors that appear
  - Verify the build produces a firmware binary
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 2. Get device into bootloader mode with user help - iterate until successful
  - EXPLICITLY ask user to disconnect device, hold BOOTSEL button, reconnect while holding, then release
  - Check if bootloader device appears using existing device detection code
  - If bootloader not detected, ask user to try BOOTSEL process again with more detailed instructionsOTSEL button process as many times as needed until device appears in bootloader mode
  - Do not proceed to flashing until bootloader mode is confirmed working
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [x] 3. Use existing firmware flasher to attempt first flash
  - Use the already-implemented `test_framework/firmware_flasher.py` 
  - Try to flash the built firmware using existing code
  - If flashing fails, ask user to put device back in bootloader mode and try again
  - Continue iterating with user on BOOTSEL button process until flashing succeeds
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 4. Debug and fix whatever breaks in the flash attempts
  - Identify specific failure points in the existing flashing code
  - Fix issues with device detection, tool paths, or communication
  - When testing fixes, explicitly ask user to put device in bootloader mode again
  - Continue asking user for BOOTSEL button help as many times as needed during debugging
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5_

- [x] 5. Verify device reconnection using existing device manager
  - Use the already-implemented `test_framework/device_manager.py`
  - Wait for device to reconnect after flashing
  - If device doesn't reconnect, ask user to manually disconnect/reconnect device
  - Test basic USB HID communication using existing command handler
  - If communication fails, ask user to try BOOTSEL button process again to reflash
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [x] 6. Create simple script that uses existing components with explicit user interaction
  - Write minimal script that calls existing firmware_flasher.py
  - Add explicit prompts asking user to press BOOTSEL button at each step
  - Include clear instructions: "Please disconnect device, hold BOOTSEL, reconnect while holding, then release"
  - Wait for user confirmation before proceeding after each BOOTSEL instruction
  - Test complete build-flash-verify cycle using existing tools
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 7. Run 3 successful cycles with user BOOTSEL assistance
  - Execute the working script 3 times successfully
  - Each time, explicitly ask user to put device in bootloader mode using BOOTSEL button
  - If any cycle fails, ask user to retry BOOTSEL process and continue until successful
  - Document the exact user instructions that work reliably
  - Confirm the process is reliable and repeatable with user assistance
  - _Requirements: 5.4, 5.5, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5_
