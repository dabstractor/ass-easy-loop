# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for establishing the most basic firmware build and flash capability so the AI agent can actually test code on real hardware. The existing automated-testing-bootloader implementation has never been tested because the agent has never successfully flashed firmware to the device.

The critical job is to get one essential thing working: the ability to build firmware, flash it to the device, and verify it's running. Once this fundamental capability exists, the agent can iterate and improve autonomously.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Basic Firmware Build Process

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to successfully build the RP2040 firmware from source code, so that I have a firmware binary ready for flashing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `cargo build --release` THEN the build SHALL complete without errors
2. WHEN the build completes THEN it SHALL produce a firmware binary in the expected location
3. WHEN build errors occur THEN I SHALL identify and fix compilation issues
4. WHEN dependencies are missing THEN I SHALL install or configure them correctly
5. WHEN the build succeeds THEN I SHALL verify the output binary is valid for RP2040

### Requirement 2: Manual Bootloader Entry with User Assistance

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to get the device into bootloader mode with the user's help, so that I can flash new firmware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need the device in bootloader mode THEN I SHALL ask the user to press and hold the BOOTSEL button
2. WHEN the user presses BOOTSEL THEN I SHALL detect the device appearing as a USB mass storage device
3. WHEN bootloader mode is confirmed THEN I SHALL verify I can access the device for firmware flashing
4. WHEN bootloader detection fails THEN I SHALL ask the user to try again with clear instructions
5. WHEN the device is in bootloader mode THEN I SHALL proceed with firmware flashing

### Requirement 3: Basic Firmware Flashing

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to flash firmware to the device using available tools, so that I can deploy new code for testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the device is in bootloader mode THEN I SHALL attempt to flash firmware using picotool if available
2. WHEN picotool is not available THEN I SHALL copy the UF2 file to the bootloader mass storage device
3. WHEN flashing starts THEN I SHALL monitor the process for completion or errors
4. WHEN flashing completes THEN I SHALL verify the device disconnects and reconnects
5. WHEN flashing fails THEN I SHALL provide clear error information and retry options

### Requirement 4: Device Reconnection Verification

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to verify the device reconnects with new firmware after flashing, so that I can confirm the flash was successful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN firmware flashing completes THEN I SHALL wait for the device to reconnect as a HID device
2. WHEN the device reconnects THEN I SHALL attempt to establish USB HID communication
3. WHEN communication is established THEN I SHALL verify the device responds to basic commands
4. WHEN the device doesn't reconnect THEN I SHALL ask the user to check connections and try manual recovery
5. WHEN verification succeeds THEN I SHALL confirm the flash cycle is complete

### Requirement 5: End-to-End Flash Cycle

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to complete one full build-flash-verify cycle successfully, so that I can iterate on firmware development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a flash cycle THEN I SHALL build firmware, flash it, and verify it's running
2. WHEN any step fails THEN I SHALL stop and work with the user to resolve the issue
3. WHEN the cycle completes successfully THEN I SHALL document what worked for future iterations
4. WHEN I can complete 3 successful cycles THEN I can consider the basic capability established
5. WHEN basic capability is proven THEN I can begin autonomous iteration and improvement

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to handle errors gracefully and work with the user to recover, so that failed attempts don't brick the device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation fails THEN I SHALL provide clear error descriptions and next steps
2. WHEN the device becomes unresponsive THEN I SHALL guide the user through manual recovery
3. WHEN flashing fails THEN I SHALL ensure the device can still enter bootloader mode manually
4. WHEN communication is lost THEN I SHALL help the user reconnect and retry
5. WHEN multiple failures occur THEN I SHALL escalate to manual recovery procedures

### Requirement 7: Tool and Environment Setup

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to ensure all necessary tools are available and configured, so that the flashing process can succeed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting THEN I SHALL verify Rust toolchain and RP2040 target are installed
2. WHEN picotool is needed THEN I SHALL check if it's available and guide installation if not
3. WHEN UF2 conversion is needed THEN I SHALL ensure uf2conv tools are available
4. WHEN dependencies are missing THEN I SHALL provide installation instructions
5. WHEN tools are ready THEN I SHALL proceed with the flashing process

### Requirement 8: Documentation of Working Process

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to document the working flashing process, so that I can repeat it reliably and improve it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN each step succeeds THEN I SHALL document the exact commands and procedures used
2. WHEN errors are resolved THEN I SHALL document the solutions for future reference
3. WHEN the process is complete THEN I SHALL create a reliable procedure for future use
4. WHEN improvements are made THEN I SHALL update the documented process
5. WHEN the process is proven THEN I SHALL use it as the foundation for autonomous operation
