# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project has accumulated numerous supporting scripts, documentation files, and test artifacts in the root directory, making it difficult to navigate and maintain. We need to establish clear organizational principles and restructure the project to improve maintainability while ensuring all existing functionality remains intact.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and organized project structure, so that I can easily navigate and understand the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the root directory THEN it SHALL contain only essential project files (Cargo.toml, README.md, .gitignore, core source directories)
2. WHEN looking for documentation THEN it SHALL be organized in a dedicated docs/ directory with clear categorization
3. WHEN searching for scripts THEN they SHALL be organized in appropriate subdirectories based on their purpose
4. WHEN accessing test artifacts THEN they SHALL be contained within appropriate test-related directories

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear organizational principles documented, so that future additions follow consistent patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new documentation THEN the system SHALL have clear guidelines for where it belongs
2. WHEN creating new scripts THEN there SHALL be established patterns for organization
3. WHEN generating test artifacts THEN they SHALL be automatically placed in appropriate locations
4. WHEN the project structure is examined THEN it SHALL follow industry-standard conventions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing functionality preserved during reorganization, so that no features are broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reorganization is complete THEN all unit tests SHALL pass
2. WHEN the device is put into debugger mode THEN HID communication SHALL work correctly
3. WHEN running existing scripts THEN they SHALL function with updated paths
4. WHEN building the project THEN it SHALL compile successfully without errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want validation scripts and test frameworks properly organized, so that testing workflows remain efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running validation scripts THEN they SHALL be accessible from a dedicated scripts/ directory
2. WHEN using the test framework THEN it SHALL remain fully functional in its organized location
3. WHEN executing CI/CD pipelines THEN they SHALL work with the new structure
4. WHEN generating test reports THEN they SHALL be placed in appropriate output directories

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want bootloader-related files properly categorized, so that bootloader functionality is easily maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with bootloader code THEN related scripts SHALL be co-located appropriately
2. WHEN debugging bootloader issues THEN diagnostic tools SHALL be easily accessible
3. WHEN flashing firmware THEN the process SHALL work seamlessly with the new organization
4. WHEN bootloader tests are run THEN they SHALL execute correctly from their organized location
